# TasksApp-Scala
This is a project for practicing Scala language, which consists of simple task app. At the moment, not using JavaScript framework for the frontend, only vanilla.
I'll keep upgrading my progress using only commits not branchs and I'll develop frontend and backend at the same time on the same branch.
